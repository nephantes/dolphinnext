This guide will walk you through how to start creating new pipelines.

Creating New Pipelines/Processes
================================

Basics of DolphinNext are explained in `Developer Tutorial <https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext-tutorial>`_. You can use our `UMASS server  <https://dolphinnext.umassmed.edu/>`_, or easily pull Docker image of Dolphinnext and start creating pipelines in your local server.

**Overview of the Tutorial**

Copying Existing Processes/Pipelines
====================================

The simpliest way to edit pipelines is creating a copy of the existing ones by clicking **copy pipeline** icon which is located just next to pipeline title.

Similarly you can create a copy of process by clicking **copy process** button on the top right of the process window.
    
.. image:: dolphinnext_images/copy_process.png
	:align: center
    
Once you copied the pipeline/process, you will own all the  permissions of your process/pipeline and you can easily modify and save on your version.
